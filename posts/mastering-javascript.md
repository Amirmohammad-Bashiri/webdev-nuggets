JavaScript powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}

printBasics();
```

```bash
# bash
npm install react
```

```jsx
import React, {useState} from "react";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevState => prevState + 1)}>{count}</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
